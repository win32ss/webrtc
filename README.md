This repository contains Supermium's WebRTC implementation; it contains a few minor modifications to remove DPI function dependencies that would otherwise require Windows 8.x.

~~# Why is the repository stuffed into a six-part ZIP archive?
There appears to be a server-side issue at GitHub where a 'git push' of a local repository cloned from a remote non-GitHub repository to an empty GitHub repository fails 
(see https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/58379). Until there is a solution to this problem, Supermium WebRTC will be distributed in this format.~~

Alternatively, just download the patch file in the root of the repository. The archive is kept in the repository for posterity.
